# 🚀 Auto Blog Posting System Setup Guide

## Overview
This system automatically generates and publishes trading education blogs to your Market Insights page every day at 9:00 AM.

## 📋 What We've Built

### 1. **Database Table** (`blogs`)
- Stores all generated blog content
- Tracks publication status and metadata
- Supports search, filtering, and categorization

### 2. **Updated Edge Functions**
- `generate-trading-blog`: Manual blog generation with auto-save
- `daily-blog-scheduler`: Automatic daily posting at 9:00 AM

### 3. **Updated Market Insights Page**
- Displays auto-generated blogs from database
- Search and filter functionality
- Professional blog listing interface

## 🔧 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migration
```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- (Already created: supabase/migrations/20250101000001-create-blogs-table.sql)
```

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Functions

#### A. Deploy `generate-trading-blog`
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Edge Functions**
2. Click **"Create a new function"**
3. Name: `generate-trading-blog`
4. Copy the complete code from `supabase/functions/generate-trading-blog/index.ts`
5. Click **"Deploy"**

#### B. Deploy `daily-blog-scheduler`
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Edge Functions**
2. Click **"Create a new function"**
3. Name: `daily-blog-scheduler`
4. Copy the complete code from `supabase/functions/daily-blog-scheduler/index.ts`
5. Click **"Deploy"**

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
In **Supabase Dashboard** → **Settings** → **Edge Functions** → **Secrets**:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### Step 4: Set Up Daily Scheduler

#### Option A: Using External Scheduler (Recommended)
1. **Sign up for a cron job service** (e.g., cron-job.org, EasyCron)
2. **Set up daily cron job** at 9:00 AM:
   ```
   0 9 * * * curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/daily-blog-scheduler
   ```

#### Option B: Using Supabase Cron (Premium Feature)
If you have Supabase Pro, you can use built-in cron:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'daily-blog-posting',
  '0 9 * * *',
  $$
  SELECT net.http_post(
    url := 'https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/daily-blog-scheduler',
    headers := '{"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer your-anon-key"}'
  );
  $$
);
```

## 🧪 Testing the System

### Test Manual Blog Generation
1. Go to your app: `http://localhost:5173/admin/blog-generator`
2. Select a topic and click **"Generate Blog"**
3. Check that the blog appears in **Market Insights** page

### Test Daily Scheduler
1. Manually trigger the scheduler:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/daily-blog-scheduler
   ```
2. Check the response and verify blog appears in database

### Test Market Insights Page
1. Go to: `http://localhost:5173/market-insights`
2. Verify blogs are loading from database
3. Test search and filter functionality

## 📊 Monitoring & Management

### View Published Blogs
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  title,
  published_at,
  status,
  difficulty_level,
  estimated_read_time
FROM blogs 
WHERE status = 'published' 
ORDER BY published_at DESC;
```

### Check Scheduler Status
```sql
-- Check if blog was published today
SELECT COUNT(*) as blogs_today
FROM blogs 
WHERE status = 'published' 
  AND published_at >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

### Manual Blog Management
```sql
-- Unpublish a blog
UPDATE blogs SET status = 'draft' WHERE id = 'blog-id';

-- Delete a blog
DELETE FROM blogs WHERE id = 'blog-id';

-- Update blog content
UPDATE blogs SET content = 'new content' WHERE id = 'blog-id';
```
